Diabetes is one of the most pervasive diseases in the world. It’s a chronic illness caused by the lack of 
inherent ability to regulate sugar in blood. Insulin, produced by the pancreas, is the component responsible 
for controlling sugar levels. The prevalence of this chronic illness in the modern era despite the 
advancements in the medical field can be attributed to many factors including auto immune diseases, 
hormonal imbalance, lifestyle choices and use of medication. These factors are contributing to the onset of
diabetes regardless of age. As diabetes don’t have a cure, prevention and early detection is important. To 
achieve this, machine learning models are being used. This paper focuses on understanding diabetes
among women recognizing the impact of hormonal fluctuations women experience regularly, particularly
during pregnancy. These effects last longer even post pregnancy, sometimes lasting throughout their
lifetime.
